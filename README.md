                                                Refacting Code for Horiseon


**What** Horiseon is a company which specializes in search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. I have reviewed and refacted the html code for their website, and have made note of all my changes within the code itself.

**Why** In order to assess the code and make improvements where necessary, and improving the websites overall accessability.

**How** By accessing the code and it's relevant counterparts via a shared folder, I was able to review it and make changes. I tested these changes by viewing the websites user interface in real time using a live server as I was making modificatios to it's code.

**Features** he website clearly demonstrates the services provided by the company. It is equipped with relevant/descriptive images and information.

**How to test my changes**

1) Open the .html document which contains the website code, in any web browser
2) Assess the accessability of the website
3) Hover over the "tab" and see that the website has now been properly labeled and identified
4) Remove the image sources withing the html document, or change the name of the images in their source folder. You will then see that in it's place will be an alternate description of what is meant to be in the images place.
5) Access and assess my changes via the github links provided
